# PROJECTS-Live-Traffic-Light-Based-Control-System-using-Xilinx-
This project, a traffic light control system was designed and implemented using Xilinx tools and FPGA technology. The system was developed to simulate and control traffic lights at an intersection, managing the flow of vehicles in real-time based on predefined timing cycles or dynamic input.
Traffic Control Logic: Designed a real-time traffic light control system using FPGA, managing signals at an intersection.
Verilog HDL & Xilinx Vivado: Implemented the system in Verilog using Xilinx Vivado tools for FPGA deployment.
Finite State Machine (FSM): Utilized FSM to manage the transitions between traffic light states (Red, Yellow, Green) based on timing or sensor input.
Timing and Delay Optimization: Implemented precise timing for each signal to ensure smooth traffic flow and minimize congestion.
Scalable Design: Capable of expanding to multiple intersections, pedestrian crossings, and real-time traffic adjustments using sensors.
